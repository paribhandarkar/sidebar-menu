# Sidebar menu

I created a sidebar menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a hamburger icon that toggles the visibility of the sidebar. When the icon is clicked, the sidebar appears with a header, a logo, and a list of menu items. I styled the menu links and the hamburger icon using CSS. To add interactivity, I used JavaScript to create event listeners for the icon and the close button. When the icon is clicked, the sidebar is shown by adding a "show-sidebar" class to the HTML element, and when the close button is clicked, the class is removed, hiding the sidebar. It's a simple project, but it demonstrates the use of basic web development skills to create an interactive user interface.
